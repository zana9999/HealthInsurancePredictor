# 🏥 Health Insurance Charges Predictor

Predict health insurance costs using Linear Regression on demographic and health features. This project showcases end-to-end machine learning, from data cleaning and feature engineering to visualization and error analysis. Interaction terms capture combined effects like smoking × BMI and smoking × age.

# 🔍 Project Description

The model predicts insurance charges based on age, BMI, smoking status, and interaction features. Linear regression quantifies the relationship between predictors and charges. Includes visualizations, correlation analysis, and detailed error metrics to evaluate performance.
